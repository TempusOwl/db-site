## What is BDSM is public and how does it look?
It can take many forms from requiring the wearing of devices like chastity cages, butt plugs, vibrators, and more. In other forms, it can be physiological domination like in Daddy/Little dynamics.
## Important Concepts
BDSM is something private between you and your consenting partner. Never outwardly display or act in a way that causes the non-consenting public to be aware of your dynamic BDSM.
Consent is important to all those around if they are present to see it. For example, if you a host event at home and your partner is an exhibitionist, receiving consent or explaining the event in detail for those attending before the event is highly important.
Some BDSM, unfortunately, takes place openly in the public (like at stores) for all ages and people to witness, like with humiliation wearing highly visible bondage gear, restraints, outfits and nudity/little clothing. At best this is disturbing to non-consenting strangers around you, at worst it can carry criminal penalties. This is often glamorized/fetished in porn and should not be something you do with a partner despite what you may see.
Humiliation/exhibition can also be achieved through safer means like online on Reddit or through consenting friends or your local dungeon if their rules permit, check with DMs on how exhibition kinks are structured there.
There are many great ways to have a BDSM experience out in public without the visible nature. Some incognito ideas can be cages, insertable vibrators, panties (feminization), and more. Personally, I would draw a line around remote control vibrators, these can work and no one will know. Others may struggle to stand. Be mindful of keeping your dynamic quiet, if people think something is up you have gone too far.
## Hidden Language
Openly communicating about BDSM is less than ideal when out in public. Idea of nonverbal language is not necessarily BDSM only, it is great for communicating things without verbal use. Style and complexity will vary based off what your needs of the dynamic are. Some examples below give an idea of how you can use non-verbal language to bring attention to concerns/express feelings that otherwise are can not be discussed openly with words.
- Tug on your ear – This can represent listen to me for a Dom or a Sub.
- Rub Palm On Your Ear – Could represent be quiet or hide what is going on.
- Run your hand through your hair – Could mean disregard last thing if you do an action by accident.
- Three taps on the hand or leg – Could mean how are you doing?
- Thumb itching nose – Could mean I am great, keep going.
- Pointer finger itching nose – Calm it down a tiny bit.
- Both hands (fingertips) rubbing side of your nose towards your eyes – Could mean you are feeling overwealmed.
- Squeezing a wrist – A safe motion meaning stop everything and talk to me when safe.
- Pointer finger+thumb on the chin rubbing it – A safe motion meaning stop everything and talk to me when safe.
