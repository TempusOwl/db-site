## Conduct
- Never cheat or engage with additional partners in an exclusive dynamic.
- Never openly talk/brag about your BDSM relationship by name-dropping your partner with others unless that is agreed upon. People often expect some anonymity and privacy in BDSM as not to affect their personal and/or professional life.
- See out and learn safety concerns for any kink you wish to practice on someone (or have done on yourself).
- Never stop learning, we are all students in this big world. Always come in with an open mind and ears.
- Never take screenshots, photo images, videos, or refer to someone being inside what could be perceived as the BDSM community, for the same reason above.
- Never be a Dom/Sub who uses their status to abuse and manipulate. Follow your partner's limits and listen/follow what they say.
- Do not use your safe word as a joke, it devalues its importance for the moment when it is truly needed.
- If you are uncomfortable/something is not right, stop. Do not push yourself beyond what you find okay to appease anyone. Your personal safety comes first.
- Do not underestimate the headspace of a submissive. Some submissives may consent to something they would not otherwise when feeling submissive. As a Dominant, you should be cautious around pushing boundaries within scenes and know the limits of your submissive.

## House Rules
If you ever partake in a local event or community check their rules and expectations before diving in. Many have specific rules that may not be obvious, such as no phone/camera use or drinking. Rules like these exist to ensure the privacy and safety of attendees, it can be a confusing venture if you do not pay attention. If you are unsure about something reach out beforehand and ask if something is alright.
