## BDSM Can Be Dangerous
BDSM can be dangerous in some scenarios, in rope bondage for example a Dom needs to be educated about nerve areas, circulation, and range of motion test. While there are safety concerns throughout BDSM that range from safe, mild to medium, BDSM should be about safety and minimizing or eliminating risk(s) that would cause any true harm to an individual. It is always recommended to read a handful of guides and safety tips focused around / specialized in your interest before engaging with what you see online or heard. Online porn videos & gifs rarely show safety precautions or explain concepts, only the end of the result leading to the possibility to miss important safety points leading to harm to you or your partner. Always be informed! Lastly, it's a great idea to not solely rely on your Dom for your safety. Learn about your own kink's safety concerns so you can be informed.
