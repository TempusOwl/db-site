This section is a draft, expect errors and issues.
## Materials
- Flexible Composites/Gels/Plastics - These vary wildly and reviews are important.
- Hard Plastics - Ideal for most people looking for a dildo without bells and whistles, these are often the cheapest styles and lack flexibility.
- Wood - Avoid wood, it's difficult to clean and absorbs moisture. It requires upkeep and if not done properly it can cause you more pain than pleasure.
- Metals - generally not a good idea to use metal, the vaginal area is quite sensitive to PH and some metals can cause reactions that range from nothing/itching to serious allergic reactions.
## NEVER USE
Glass or cheap unlisted plastics formulas as these can yourself or your partner.
