## What Is BDSM?
Is an acronym meant to signify the different kinks of the kink community, together they are referred to as BDSM. The image below explains how each set of kinks relates to the BDSM acronym. BDSM in itself is a broad community with immense diversity, there is something out there for everyone. BDSM is not just masochism/sadism there are gentler sides like "caregiving" among others. It can be overwhelming at first once you see the diversity of kinks in the BDSM community, taking steps and exploring is part of the fun. BDSM is about exploring what you want to explore and feel comfortable with. Always remember BDSM is about your personal journey to find what makes you deviant and the connections you make with others along the way.

## What isnâ€™t BDSM?
What you have been exposed to in porn is often more complicated and intense than what people practice in their own dynamics at home, especially when starting out in the community. Pornographic content uses expensive sets with equally expensive toys and other kit to make video content around rope suspension, restrain rigs, sybians and more. This stuff cost $1000's of dollars. While many Doms will have a box of tools and toys, most do not have $10,000 dungeon studio in their spare bedroom. If you like what you see in porn, you can seek out these experiences by involving yourself at your local dungeon. These places can be fully equipped with toys and equipment, though check the fine print on what is available. Generally, you must seek out these experiences yourself. 

Everyone is a slave 24/7! This is not the case. Total Power Exchange or 24/7 is a kink in the community, but it requires to be in person and is a SERIOUS commitment. Some practice a "style" of 24/7 online, but it's a much different beast in person. 24/7 is not as prevalent as depicted in media (as found in Fifty Shades Of Grey) or pornographic content as it has to be something you really try to seek out for and meet the right people. It's expected/encouraged for people to maintain their work, personal life, and friendship obligations while within BDSM TPE dynamics. TPE is an entire topic in itself and should be something you do research on, when it is done poorly it can be dangerous to a dynamic or even health.

## BDSM Can Be Dangerous
BDSM can be dangerous in some scenarios, in rope bondage for example a Dom needs to be educated about nerve areas, circulation, and range of motion test. While there are safety concerns throughout BDSM that range from safe, mild to medium, BDSM should be about safety and minimizing or eliminating risk(s) that would cause any true harm to an individual. It is always recommended to read a handful of guides and safety tips focused around / specialized in your interest before engaging with what you see online or heard. Online porn videos & gifs rarely show safety precautions or explain concepts, only the end of the result leading to the possibility to miss important safety points leading to harm to you or your partner. Always be informed! Lastly, it's a great idea to not solely rely on your Dom for your safety. Learn about your own kink's safety concerns so you can be informed.
