## What Is BDSM About?
Whether you are a woman who finds the thrill of having a guy being a bit rougher or a guy who prefers a girl on top, these concepts mesh into BDSM concepts. BDSM draws greatly from a pure submissive and dominant relationship naturally. BDSM is about the personal journey to find what makes you deviant and the connections with others you make along the way.

## What isnâ€™t BDSM?
BDSM comes in many colors, most people who practice BDSM do not even have a dedicated dungeon and make use of their bedroom or other living spaces within their means.
It looks painful and scary! What you may have been exposed to in porn is often more complicated and intense than what people practice in their own dynamics at home, especially when starting out in the community. Pornographic content uses expensive sets with equally expensive toys and another kit to make video content around rope suspension, restrain rigs, sybians and more. This stuff cost $1000's of dollars. While many Doms will have a box of tools and toys, what you find in BDSM porn is uncommon unless you seek that. One of the parts about BDSM is if you dislike something note it down as a limit/dislike for yourself and let potential partners know and journey on!

Everyone is a slave 24/7 to their master and I am locked away in their dungeon! This is not the case. Total Power Exchange or 24/7 is a kink in the community, but it requires to be in person and is a SERIOUS commitment. Some practice a "style" of 24/7 online, but it's a much different beast in person. 24/7 is not as prevalent as depicted in media (as found in Fifty Shades Of Grey) or pornographic content as it has to be something you really try to seek out for and meet the right people. It's expected/encourged for people to maintain their work, personal life, and friendship obligations while within BDSM dynamics.

## What does the term BDSM represent?
The BDSM acronym can be found below, it's admittedly a tricky one but it represents the relationship between different sects of BDSM. Some of the letters represent more than one word at the same time, making it not a typical acronym.
