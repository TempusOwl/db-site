## Conduct & Expectations
- Never cheat or engage with additional partners in an exclusive dynamic.
- Never openly talk/brag about your BDSM relationship by name-dropping your partner with others unless you talked about being "public". People often expect some anonymity and privacy in BDSM as not to affect their personal and/or professional life.
- Never use your Dom status to pressure someone into doing something they are uncomfortable with IE: Giving Nudes that was stated as being a limit.
- Do not use your safe word as a joke, it devalues its importance for the moment when it is truly needed.
- If you are uncomfortable/something is not right, stop. Do not push yourself beyond what you find okay to appease anyone. Your safety comes first.
- Never share "personal" photos and videos, unless they consent to that.
- Do not underestimate the headspace of a submissive. Some submissives may to consent to something they would not otherwise when feeling submissive. As a Dominant, you should be cautious around pushing boundaries within scenes and know the limits of your submissive. Discussing changes/ideas prior to be safe and protect your Sub even if they won't themselves. If things happen in the moment know the risk and watch out for your partner and their body language/tone.

## House Rules
If you ever partake in a local event check their rules and expections before going. Many have specific rules that may not be obvious, such as no phone/camera use or drinking. Rules like these exist to ensure the privacy of attendees, but it can be a confusing venture if you do not pay attention. If you are unsure about something reach out beforehand and ask if something is alright before attempting it or showing up.
