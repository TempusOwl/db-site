## What is "BDSM"?
BDSM is the term used to represent an interest in kink culture, as well as name for the community overall. BDSM is a broad community with great diversity, there is something out there for everyone. BDSM is not just masochism/sadism, there are gentler sides like "caregiving" among many others. It can be overwhelming at first once you see the diversity of kinks in the BDSM community. Taking baby steps and exploring what is out there you enjoy (or not) is part of the journey we all take. To be in the BDSM community, it means you have sought to educate yourself and put your best foot forward to find your voice. Forgetting what notions the media/movies/porn have taught you about BDSM and involve yourself in the BDSM community to learn first hand, through online communities/blogs like ours or your local community. Always remember BDSM is about your personal journey to find what makes you deviant and the connections you make with others along the way. Always remember, lead with an open mind.

## BDSM dynamics must have X
One of the most common views from people outside the community is how BDSM is based around dungeons and tons of scary equipment/toys. While these are popular and prevalent concepts, they are not the initial path you will find yourself on when you are starting out. Reasoning is simply accessibility. A dedicated dungeon can easily approach $1000's in equipment, making it not easy to achieve for most to throw in a spare bedroom at a whim. Meaning most relationships/dynamics make do with what they have, such as a modest equipment/toy chest of things they use regularly. It's beneficial to consider investing at least under $100 dollars on toys and explore what works and what does not work for you before investing on more expensive equipment. You do not need $100's of dollars in equipment to start out. If a Dom or Sub wants to take things to the next level to have a dungeon, consider renting first and see if you both like it before investing.

## BDSM Can Be Dangerous
BDSM can be dangerous in some scenarios, in rope bondage for example a Dom needs to be educated about nerve areas, circulation, and range of motion test. While there are safety concerns throughout BDSM that range from safe, mild to medium, BDSM should be about safety and minimizing or eliminating risk(s) that would cause any true harm to an individual. It is always recommended to read a handful of guides and safety tips focused around / specialized in your interest before engaging with what you see online or heard. Online porn videos & gifs rarely show safety precautions or explain concepts, only the end of the result leading to the possibility to miss important safety points leading to harm to you or your partner. Always be informed! Lastly, it's a great idea to not solely rely on your Dom for your safety. Learn about your own kink's safety concerns so you can be informed if you are a Sub.
