## What is "BDSM"?
BDSM is the term used to represent an interest in kink culture, as well as name for the community overall. BDSM is a broad community with great diversity, there is something out there for everyone. BDSM is not just masochism/sadism, there are gentler sides like "caregiving" among many others. It can be overwhelming at first once you see the diversity of kinks in the BDSM community. Taking baby steps and exploring what is out there you enjoy (or not) is part of the journey we all take. To be in the BDSM community, it means you have sought to educate yourself and put your best foot forward to find your voice. Forgetting what notions the media/movies/porn have taught you about BDSM and involve yourself in the BDSM community, through online communities/blogs like ours or your local community. Always remember BDSM is about your personal journey to find what makes you deviant and the connections you make with others along the way.

### What isnâ€™t BDSM?
What you have been exposed to in porn is often more complicated that what you will initially come across. Pornographic content uses expensive sets with equally expensive toys and other kit to make video content around rope suspension, restrain rigs, sybians and more. This stuff cost $1000's of dollars. While many Doms will have a box of tools and toys, most do not have a $10,000 dungeon studio in their spare bedroom. If you like what you see in porn, you can seek out these experiences by involving yourself at your local dungeon. These places can be fully equipped with toys and equipment, though check the fine print on what is available. Generally, you must seek out these experiences yourself. BDSM for vast majority is practiced at home just like any sexual relationship where they have the most access.

Everyone is a slave 24/7! Total Power Exchange or 24/7 is a kink in the community, but it requires SERIOUS commitment. Some practice a "style" of 24/7 online, but it's a much different beast in person. 24/7 is not as prevalent as depicted in the media (like Fifty Shades Of Grey). It has to be something you try to seek out. BDSM is always about people maintaining their work, personal life, and friendship obligations while in BDSM dynamics. TPE is an entire topic in itself and should be something you do research on, when it is done poorly it can be dangerous to a relationship or even physical health.

#### BDSM Can Be Dangerous
BDSM can be dangerous in some scenarios, in rope bondage for example a Dom needs to be educated about nerve areas, circulation, and range of motion test. While there are safety concerns throughout BDSM that range from safe, mild to medium, BDSM should be about safety and minimizing or eliminating risk(s) that would cause any true harm to an individual. It is always recommended to read a handful of guides and safety tips focused around / specialized in your interest before engaging with what you see online or heard. Online porn videos & gifs rarely show safety precautions or explain concepts, only the end of the result leading to the possibility to miss important safety points leading to harm to you or your partner. Always be informed! Lastly, it's a great idea to not solely rely on your Dom for your safety. Learn about your own kink's safety concerns so you can be informed if you are a submissive.
