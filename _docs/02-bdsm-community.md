## The Community
BDSM is a community first and foremost, with its own expectations, rules & limits that we entrust with each other. It is far more meaningful than a tag in PornHub, admittedly long ago this was my view about BDSM until I met someone who taught me there so much more to BDSM. The BDSM Community has an intense focus on promoting and ensuring safety with each other. Often local gatherings, sites, and online communities like ours exist to promote a safer exploration into BDSM for others, as well as a way to meet others safely. If you ever sought out your local community you will see a wide array of rules and expectations to participate in events. Local gatherings often work through vouches and other means to foster a safe and discrete community, this is all to promote safety. Alternatively, there are many great public events you can join through fetlife.com, that can open more doors to private gatherings through the connections you make along the way in the community.

## How does policing work?
In our daily life, we all do our small part and police one another. People like to hype themselves up as being an expert of a kink to appeal to more attractive when in reality they don't know the basics of safety. If you see someone being unsafe, tell them so and let others know. Less bad people in the community, the better community. We all benefit from that.

In local events like dungeons, there are people called Dungeons Monitors. These people take the form of a staff figure who moderates events and ensures everyone is safe when being kinky. If they see unsafe behaviors, or if rules are being broken ( such as drug use) they stop your scene and may kick you out depending. Rules can vary by place by place, safety is important and many have strict no substance rules, even alcohol. Dungeon Monitors typically take their role quite seriously, if something were to happen it is their responsibility. If they tell you to stop, you stop. Their authority is absolute and it's not to be questioned even if you disagree, their house, their rules. Small mistakes happen and if you screw up something you listen and learn. Dungeons Monitors usually have significant experience and are a good way to ask about rules, kink safety, or protocol if you are unsure about something new to you. Dungeon Masters are the last role you may find in your local community. It denotes the person who owns or manages the event, usually in charge of the Dungeon Monitors (maybe one themselves in practice too). 

##  To Be In A Dynamic
BDSM dynamics are something precious, they are to be taken seriously just like a relationship. If you serial abuser, cheater, or overall shitty person expect to be ostracized by those in your local community. Therefore always follow rules, put your best foot forward and raise others up by educating them so we are all rise together as a community. Remember, there is little patience for people who do not hold our values.

## How can I tell who is serious?
An important sign to knowing if someone respects BDSM (and potentially you) is if they sought to educate themselves about BDSM and safety for the kinks they enjoy. Many say they are into BDSM, but can't answer basic safety concepts. Try to educate them, but if they play the "I know it all" card, that should be a dealer breaker.
