## Honorifics
Unfinished.

## Setting Dynamic Goals
Before engaging in any activity that pushes beyond what two may consider "friendly" you should establish answers to some of these important questions. Communicating your goals and expectations before things get going is the best way to avoid systemic issues further down the road.
- Is this casual or are we dating with long term goals?
- Are we exclusive?
- Are we online only or IRL. Doing photos, video, voice, in person? What kind of dynamic are you looking for?
Explain/know what you want out of your dynamic with your partner. Do not fall prey to an ambiguous dynamic where you do not know what "we are". There are many colors to BDSM. Asking your partner questions above can help you a lot in setting expectations early to build an amazing dynamic.
