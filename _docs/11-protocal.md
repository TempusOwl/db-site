Protocol levels are the expectation of how a dynamic should work between two people. There is necessarily no agreed-upon meaning of what each protocol means, so always discuss expectations with your partners as things can differ slightly. With that said the rest of this article is going to explain what you will commonly find in each protocol level in the BDSM community and what you can expect but first some important concepts!
## Important Concepts
## Knowing Each Other's Obligations
Anything that is important to life is considered an obligation. Obligations can take many forms. Simple things like paying rent, working a job, religious beliefs, college, and family are just to name a few. These obligations should be respected, and limits should be listened to regardless of the protocol. If a BDSM protocol is harmful to a person's obligations (or likely put them at risk) consider revaluating and adapting to form a safer protocol that fits within each other's obligations.

## Behavior/Mind
- Basic actions like going to the bathroom, sitting down, or eating may require permission from your dominant.
- Your tone, inflection, voice (or orgasm) volume level, and words may be set to what your dominant wants.
