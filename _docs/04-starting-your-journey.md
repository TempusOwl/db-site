## Starting Your Journey
You must think to yourself what do you want out of BDSM? If you have a certain picture in your head find out what kinks that involve and start seeing what exists out there for you. Once you have your goals, communicate your intent. By finding your BDSM Role and the kinks that interest you, you will be able to paint the picture of who you are to others, allowing you to find the right people who mesh with what you want out of BDSM. Your role is by far one of the most significant things in determining what doors it will open for you. As you dive deeper you may find your role changes, or your kinks change and that is all part of the journey. The next section is dedicated just to BDSM roles.

## Online Journey
There are many great blogs, forums, and communities out there for BDSM. Due to BDSM being represented as sexual sometimes, its often against TOS of many social media services because of porn etc... this can make it problematic to find a safe place to run a BDSM community online without being banned. Our community with ~1000+ members exists on Discord and is public to join https://join.devinantbound.com . Discord has fairly modest rules regarding sexual content making it a safe place. 

## Local Community
The most accessible way to see what exists for BDSM in your community is through sites like fetlife.com, which let you search for events based in your area. This can be a great way to make connections with people. Fetlife specifically, lets you see who is attending so you can decide if it's a vibe you like or not by checking people's profiles first.
