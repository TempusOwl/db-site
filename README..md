## Warning
This project contains some adult themes and language.

## What is it?
It's a blog/info site meant to promote safety and education for the kink community. The site contains documation and important safety info. I joined the community in 2016 and wanted to help others be safe by giving helpful information I wish I knew when I started.

## Contributing
As per Github's rules I do not want any contrubtions to the project to contain overly sexual content like visually nude people or NSFW video content *unless* its safe enough to be on YouTube. I wish to maintain the project as educational and informational as its entire focus.

## License & Adaptations
If you like its theme & design I encounter you to checkout https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes

**!!Please do not fork the project!! I have some hard coded hacky stuff that could create problems in your projects (or mine). Checkout the repo above and build from the latest version following his quick start guide if you like how my page looks. **
